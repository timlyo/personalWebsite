# Evergreen Scouts Images

One of the key requirements for the website is that members can upload images to the website. This will enable users to easily see the activities that our group has been involved in, and will act as promotional material for the group.

This presents 4 key problem areas.

* Upload experience must be fluid and simple
* Finding past photos must be easy
* Grouping photos into albums must be simple and intuitive
* Photos should be stored with as high quality, yet small file size as possible. Photos details should be editable and photos should be deletable after upload

## Upload 

A drag an drop interface is preferred. Dropzone.js is a customisable interface that handles the uploading.

Other considerations are titling the files, removing meta data, adding descriptions.


## Search/Gallery

Search by album, date, location, unit
results returned by ajax
full screen present mode/automatic slideshow

## Albums

Group photos by date, select all photos from dates
Group photos by location, must use work around if no location
Group files uploaded at the same time. hidden uuid?

Group photos by name scheme i.e. identify camera model

Select create/edit album, show list of all photos/groups of photos and click to toggle adding/removing
