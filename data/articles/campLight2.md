#Camp light 2

After [yesterdays witterings](/articles/campLight1) about making a light, I decided to get off my arse and actually do some testing. I extensively tested the difference in brightness between the RGB LEDs and the *ultra bright* white LEDs. 10 minutes later, and many spots in my vision, I concluded that the ultra bright LEDs were aptly named.

The RGB LEDs also have the advantage of being pre diffused, no spots on the case with a higher viewing angle, and if they're all I'm using then it will be all colour rather than mostly white light with a coloured tint. Much nicer.

I've also done some thinking about the controls that I want my light to have. Brightness control should be simple, and is something I'd really like. Redshift like colour control would be nice. Then I'd like something to control the direction, and something to switch other modes.

That's two trimpots; one for brightness, and one for colour; and two buttons; one for direction control, one for switching between modes. 

Which brings me onto modes:

* Solid light
* Candle flicker
* Colour changer or *Ooo pretty lights mode*
* Flash to music mode 
    * Full flash, Disco mode
    * Slight pulse
    
Each press of the button will switch the mode, all of them will obey the brightness setting, and most will obey the temperature setting. I'm not yet sure which should obey the colour setting, testing will be involved.
